# custom-chrome-homepage-
using a simple https app on mobile you can make a fully custom chrome home page 

download the simple https app from the playstore.
copy the ip adress once you started the server and set the file directory to where the costom chrome homepage file are located.
now paste the ip you have copied into you chrome hompage settings
close all you tabs and chrome.
lunch it one more time and you should get the custom chrome page.

note:
depening on the type of device you are using the google app itself might lunch when you press the search button.
if this happens i recomend to disable the google app fo time being.

thanks.
